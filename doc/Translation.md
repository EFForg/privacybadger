# Translating Privacy Badger

We need your help to translate Privacy Badger to every possible language.
If you think you can help translating to your local language, here you
will find instructions to help you in the process.

At the moment we handle the translations of Privacy Badger with two different
platforms: Transifex and GitHub. Feel free to use the tool you prefer.

When translating you should always use the original (English) version as the 
reference. You can also use existing translations from other languages to help
you in case of doubt but you should always consider the English version as the correct one.

## GitHub

Translations on GitHub are done with JSON files.
Each language has its own folder inside `src/_locales` (e.g. 'es' for Spanish,
'ru' for Russian, etc.).`
Inside each of these folders there is a JSON file that contains the translated
strings for that language. Each entry in the JSON file follows this structure:

    "string_identifier": {
        "message": "String text"
        "description": "Some useful info"
    }
    
The translated string is the `"String text"` part and you should **NOT** change
any other part of the entry.

The `"Some useful info"` part sometimes contains useful information (in English) about the
string. Usually it provides the context of the string (if it is a button, an heading,... and
where it is located inside the UI). You should never translate it.

To contribute to the Privacy Badger translation through GitHub, first check the
status of your local language translation: if you don't see a folder with your 
[local language code](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/i18n?csw=1#localeTable), the translation for that language is missing. In this case
you should follow the instructions below to set up the JSON file for your language.
If the translation for your language is already there you can contribute by checking
its accuracy and by correcting any errors you find (see below for instructions).

#### Add a new language

To add a new language to GitHub, follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository;
2. Inside your fork, create a folder in `src/_locales` and name it
with your [local language code](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/i18n?csw=1#localeTable);
3. Copy the `en_US/messages.json` files inside the folder you created;
4. Start translating each message to your language by replacing the
English strings with the translated ones;
5. When you have completed the translation, [open a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/). Here you can find
an example pull request for a translation: [#1270](https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadger/pull/1270).

#### Correct an existing translation

To correct errors in an existing translation:

1. Fork this repository;
2. Open your local language JSON file and apply the changes;
3. When you have completed your work, [open a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/).
Here you can find a great example of a pull request for a translation: 
[#1270](https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadger/pull/1270)).

## Transifex

To contribute to translations through Transifex you should have
an account on the Transifex website. You can create a free account from the 
[Transifex homepage](https://www.transifex.com/).

To translate Privacy Badger with Transifex, go to the [Privacy Badger Transifex project](https://www.transifex.com/eff/privacy-badger/dashboard/), log in to your account and click on the Translate button.
The Transifex platform is quite intuitive to use. For any questions about
Transifex refer to its [documentation](https://docs.transifex.com/).

Before starting your work, send a message to [ghostwords](https://www.transifex.com/user/profile/ghostwords/),
who will check if Transifex and GitHub translations are correctly
synced. To send him a message, go to [his profile](https://www.transifex.com/user/profile/ghostwords/)
and click on "Send message". This will help avoid translating
something that has already been translated or that is currently being
translated. Also, send ghostwords a message when you have finished your work
so that he will upload your translation to GitHub.

In case of doubts when translating on Transifex, you can leave comments
for the string in question in the Transifex translations editor.
