PRELIMINARY DNT POLICY

This domain interprets DNT as a request for an opt out of collection and
retention of visitors' reading habits, which we will respect, subject to
reasonable exceptions that respect user privacy. 

This is a temporary document.  A full DNT Policy is being drafted at
https://www.eff.org/dnt-policy .  When that document is finished, this domain may
decide to adopt it.

You can agree to this same policy by posting it at
https://subdomain.example.com/.well-known/dnt-policy.txt, where "subdomain" is
any domain to which the policy applies.  Commonly it will be posted on third
party domains.  HTTPS is required.
