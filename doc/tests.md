# Travis CI

Every pull request runs the full suite of functional and unit tests on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/). We test on latest stable Chrome and Firefox releases, as well as on Chrome Beta, Firefox Beta and Firefox ESR.

See [`.travis.yml`](/.travis.yml) for Travis configuration, [`scripts/setup_travis.sh`](/scripts/setup_travis.sh) for test setup, and [`scripts/run_travis.sh`](/scripts/run_travis.sh) for test execution procedures.

We use [ESLint](https://eslint.org) to flag potential JavaScript errors and style issues. See [`.eslintrc.yml`](/.eslintrc.yml) and [`.eslintignore`](/.eslintignore) for specifics.

# Unit tests

We use [QUnit](https://qunitjs.com/) for unit tests. To run them, click on the badger icon next to the URL bar to open the popup.
Then in the popup, click on the gear icon (âš™) to open the options page.
Your browser should navigate to an internal URL that starts with `chrome-extension://` or `moz-extension://` and ends with `/skin/options.html`.
Replace `/skin/options.html` with `/tests/index.html` and hit enter.
This will open the unit tests and run them.

Unit tests are located in [`/src/tests/tests`](/src/tests/tests). The unit test dependencies are in [`/src/tests/lib`](/src/tests/lib). Please add unit tests whenever possible.

# Functional tests

Our functional tests are written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and driven by
[Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) and [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).
To run them in Chrome, you'll need to [install `chromedriver`](https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadger/blob/f780438ca146e932ebc80fa163ddcfdae4e56c25/scripts/setup_travis.sh#L4-L12). In Firefox, you need to [install `geckodriver`](https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadger/blob/f780438ca146e932ebc80fa163ddcfdae4e56c25/scripts/setup_travis.sh#L14-L28).
You also need some Python packages that can be installed by running:
```bash
$ pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
```

Now you should be able to run the Selenium tests!
Try them out by running the code below.
This should take several minutes.
```bash
$ BROWSER=chrome pytest -v
```

The `BROWSER` environment variable must be set. It must be one of:
* `BROWSER=/path/to/a/browser`
* the name of a browser executable that can be found like `which $BROWSER`
* or simply `BROWSER=chrome` or `BROWSER=firefox` if you have them installed

## Examples

Note that to use a debugger like `pdb` or `ipdb` you must pass the `-s` (`--capture=no`) flag to pytest.
```bash
# run qunit_test.py, with firefox, with verbose output (-v)
$ BROWSER=/usr/bin/firefox pytest -v tests/selenium/qunit_test.py

# run a specific test on a specific class in a specific module, on google-chrome-stable
$ BROWSER=google-chrome-stable pytest super_cookie_test.py::SuperCookieTest::test_should_detect_ls_of_third_party_frame

# run any tests whose name (including the module and class) matches the string cookie_test
# this is often useful as a less verbose way to run a single test
$ BROWSER=firefox pytest -k cookie_test
```

More pytest invocations can be found [here](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.html) (these are very useful).

If you are on Linux, you can also run the tests headlessly (without displaying a GUI).
Install `Xvfb` with your system package manager, then set the `ENABLE_XVFB=1` environment variable.
Like this:

```bash
$ BROWSER=~/Downloads/firefox/firefox ENABLE_XVFB=1 pytest -s -v -k pbtest_org
```
