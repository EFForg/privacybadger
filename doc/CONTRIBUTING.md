Ignorance is a fleeting virtue. Sometimes our developers are blinded by
familiarity with the codebase and development process. If you find something
confusing, esoteric, non-obvious, or uncool speak up! We don't bite. We believe
in making Privacy Badger better by making it easier for you to contribute.

Thank you!
