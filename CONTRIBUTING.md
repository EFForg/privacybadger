# Contributing to Privacy Badger

Welcome dear contributor! There are many ways to help Privacy Badger. From
quick and whimsical to involved and academic. From JavaScript to Japanese, from
algorithmic to stylistic. There is surely a way you can help.

Here is a quick orientation to guide your adventure:

* Did we break a site? We want to fix it,
  so we wrote a [guide to fixing broken sites](/doc/fixing-broken-sites.md).
* Want to help translate Privacy Badger? Working on a pull request that
  involves updating translations?
  Please see our [guide to translating Privacy Badger](/doc/Translation.md).
* To review issues we would like help with, visit our
  ["good first issue"](https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadger/labels/good%20first%20issue)
  and
  ["help wanted"](https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadger/labels/help%20wanted)
  labels.
