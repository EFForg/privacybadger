# Contributing

Welcome dear contributor, there are many ways to help Privacy Badger. From quick
and whimsical to involved and academic. From JavaScript to Japanese. From
algorithmic and O(nÂ²) to grammatical and stylistic. There is surely a way you
can help. Here's a quick orientation to guide your adventure:

* Did we break a site? We want to fix it, so we wrote [**this how-to
  guide**](/doc/fixing-broken-sites.md) for fixing broken sites.
* Security vulnerabilities can be reported privately at
  [vulnerabilities@eff.org](mailto:vulnerabilities@eff.org), the GPG key and
  other information can be found [here](https://www.eff.org/security).
* Translations are currently done on GitHub. Here is a great
  [example](https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadger/pull/1270) of a
  translation pull request. See the [translations
  label](https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadger/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3Atranslations%20)
  for related issues and more example pull requests.
* Tests are crucial, so here's a [**guide**](/doc/tests.md) on how to use them.
