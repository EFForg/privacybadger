Welcome dear contributor, there are many ways to help Privacy Badger. From quick
and whimsical to involved and academic. From JavaScript to Japanese. From
algorithmic and O(nÂ²) to grammatical and stylistic. There is surely a way you
can help. Here's a quick orientation to guide your adventure:

* Did we break a site? We want to fix it, so we wrote [**this how-to
  guide**](/doc/fixing-broken-sites.md) for fixing broken sites.
* Security vulnerabilities can be reported privately at
