        If Selenium would let us just programmatically launch an extension from its icon,

        But! We can open a new tab and set the url to the extension's popup html page and
        test away. That's how most devs test extensions. But**2!! PB's popup code uses
        the current tab's url to report the current tracker status.  And since we changed
        the current tab's url when we loaded the popup as a tab, the popup loses all the
        blocker status information from the original tab.

        The workaround is to execute a new convenience function in the popup codebase that
        looks for a given url in the tabs and, if it finds a match, refreshes the popup
        with the associated tabid. Then the correct status information will be displayed
