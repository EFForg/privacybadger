Privacy Badger
==============
Privacy Badger is a browser extension that automatically learns to block hidden trackers. Privacy Badger is made by the leading digital rights nonprofit [EFF](https://www.eff.org) to stop companies from spying on you.

Privacy Badger sends the [Global Privacy Control](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/) signal to opt you out of data sharing and selling, and the [Do Not Track](https://www.eff.org/issues/do-not-track) signal to tell companies not to track you. If trackers ignore these signals, Privacy Badger will learn to block them.

Besides automatic tracker blocking, Privacy Badger comes with privacy features like [click-to-activate replacements](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/01/privacy-badger-puts-you-control-widgets) for potentially useful trackers (video players, comments widgets, etc.), and link cleaning on [Facebook](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/05/privacy-badger-rolls-out-new-ways-fight-facebook-tracking) and [Google](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/09/new-privacy-badger-prevents-google-mangling-more-your-links-and-invading-your).
